# Game Concept: Gravitational Orbit Simulator

Game Overview:
The Gravitational Orbit Simulator is a simulation. Players take on the role of an interstellar explorer tasked with navigating through a vast and dynamic universe filled with celestial bodies, such as planets, moons, and stars.
Game Mechanics:

# Celestial Body Interaction:
   Each celestial body in the game has its own gravitational field, mass, and radius, which affect nearby objects.
   Players can navigate their spacecraft by utilizing the gravitational forces of celestial bodies to slingshot or alter their trajectory.
   Gravity assists and orbital maneuvers play a crucial role in conserving fuel and achieving desired destinations efficiently.

# Spacecraft Control:
   Players control a spacecraft equipped with propulsion systems and navigation tools.
   Maneuvering the spacecraft requires careful planning and execution to avoid collisions with celestial bodies and other hazards.
   Players can adjust the thrust, direction, and velocity of their spacecraft to navigate through complex gravitational fields.

# Dynamic Universe:
   The game features a procedurally generated universe with diverse planetary systems.
   Celestial bodies orbit dynamically, affecting gravitational interactions and creating ever-changing environments for exploration and navigation.
